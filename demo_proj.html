  <Br><P>Contemporary climate change includes both global warming and its impacts on Earth's weather patterns.
 There have been previous periods of climate change, but the current changes are distinctly more rapid and not due to natural causes.
Instead, they are caused by the emission of greenhouse gases, mostly carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane.
 Burning fossil fuels for energy use creates most of these emissions.
 Agriculture, steelmaking, cement production, and forest loss are additional sources.
Greenhouse gases are transparent to sunlight, allowing it through to heat the Earth's surface. 
When the Earth emits that heat as infrared radiation the gases absorb it, trapping the heat near the Earth's surface.
 As the planet heats up it causes changes like the loss of sunlight-reflecting snow cover, amplifying global warming.

<BR>Global warming:-
<BR><P>The climate system experiences various cycles on its own which can last for years, decades or even centuries.Other changes are caused by an imbalance of energy that is "external" to the climate system, but not always external to the Earth.Examples of external forcings include changes in the concentrations of greenhouse gases, solar luminosity, volcanic eruptions, and variations in the Earth's orbit around the Sun.
To determine the human contribution to climate change, known internal climate variability and natural external forcings need to be ruled out. A key approach is to determine unique "fingerprints" for all potential causes, then compare these fingerprints with observed patterns of climate change.For example, solar forcing can be ruled out as a major cause. Its fingerprint would be warming in the entire atmosphere. Yet, only the lower atmosphere has warmed, consistent with greenhouse gas forcing.Attribution of recent climate change shows that the main driver is elevated greenhouse gases, but that aerosols also have a strong effect.
